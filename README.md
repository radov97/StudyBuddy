Productive communication has always been key to beneficial relationships. During required 
quarantine, many people work and study from home with little to no personal interaction, 
except with their families, some of whom even without families. 
There are always students who are not so sociable and struggle to meet new buddies or find 
people to debate course materials. The less communication people have, the more doubtful 
they become of other folks. This can induce others to be more defensive, and cause a 
dangerous loop where loneliness leads to suspicion, which produces defensiveness, and later, 
which emphasizes the conjecture that leads to further isolation. 

The main goal of this project is to create a friendly and reliable virtual environment in which 
students interact. The idea of a dedicated platform for study and interaction is valuable for 
young people. They can ask questions about anything for any specialisation. Access is free and 
unlimited, so many students who do not know each other can study together. 
The project begins from a simple premise, a reliable buddy pairing platform, straightforward to 
use by everyone. Each person is unique in their own way. Therefore, in the first initial phase, 
the research process transposed the mind of the average student and determined what would 
convince one to use such a platform. To identify the best features, an opinion survey containing 
13 questions was distributed to both students from the University of Liverpool and students 
from other faculties. 

Everything starts with the assumption that the technologies used for this platform must be 
permissive to maintain, have a future perspective and be accessible to other possible project 
participants. The front end of the application will be equipped with the latest technologies for 
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6. In addition, external libraries including the latest Bootstrap and 
jQuery will be used for a better user experience. 

On the other hand, the back end of the application is maintained with the well-known scripting 
language PHP and the open-source relational database management system MySQL. Although 
they are not the latest technologies in the client-server relationship, they have substantial
documentation and are easy to maintain and operate by anyone. Ideally, a secured online 
application, easy to maintain, accessible and easy to use, will be available and not difficult to 
install on the University of Liverpool dedicated web server.

Overall, the importance of communication, especially in the student environment, is crucial. 
The study reports students would be interested in interacting, but they do not have an 
environment, where they can meet students with whom they have things in common. 
The outcome of the project is realistic, and offers a decent platform, where they can get in 
touch, from where they will later meet or keep connected in the virtual environment.
